			<div class = 'description'>
				<p>     Hi, and welcome to my portfolio. My name is William Chatterson and I’m a junior in the <strong>University of Michigan’s School of Information (SI)</strong>, an interdisciplinary program which focuses on the intersection of people, technology, and information. Within SI, I specialize in user experience (UX) &amp design. I see myself as <strong>action-oriented</strong> and as a <strong>collaborator</strong>. I especially love working with creative people, weaving together ideas, and producing something tangible to be proud of. Outside of that, <strong>I love culture</strong>- especially niche or foreign cultures. I really became fascinated with the concept after studying/living in Amman, Jordan for about four months (where I also developed advanced Arabic language skills). I see culture as being an aggregated reflection of individual’s choices, behavior, and identity, and I see <strong>UX &amp design</strong> as being a direct way reach and <strong>impact</strong> people by utilizing aspects of both culture and psychology.
				</p>
				<p>     I’m experienced with a number of UX methods including remote and in-person usability testing, comparative analysis, and heuristic evaluation. Down the page you will find tangible representation of my experience with both UX &amp design as well as my resume. <strong>However</strong>, I’d like to note that the first element of my portfolio is actually this website, which I built from scratch.

The goal was to create an effective logo for Galaxy, a conference which brings together intellectuals and leaders from around the world to focus for a day on creating clean, sustainable solutions to modern problems. For this project I developed a main logo, color variations from that logo, and child logos which would serve as marks for the sub-conferences within the main event.</p>
